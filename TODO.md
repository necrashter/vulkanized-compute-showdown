# Optimizations

- More efficient swap chain recreation, see vulkan tut comments
- _"Using a UBO this way is not the most efficient way to pass frequently changing values to the shader. A more efficient way to pass a small buffer of data to shaders are push constants. We may look at these in a future chapter."_
